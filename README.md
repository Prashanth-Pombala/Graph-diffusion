# Graph-diffusion
## The project performs molecule genration using graph diffusion on the qm9 dataset

The project uses an autoencoder and graph denoiser to generate molecules using graph diffusion. It has the following features:

*Uses the QM9 dataset
*An auntoencoder is first trained on the input graph
*Forward process on the diffusion is performed
*A GNN is used as a denoiser in the diffusion reverse process
